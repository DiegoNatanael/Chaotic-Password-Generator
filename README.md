## üìñ About The Project

This project explores a non-traditional method of generating random data. Instead of relying on standard pseudo-random number generators (`Math.random()`), it uses the state variables (angles and angular velocities) of a simulated double pendulum‚Äîa classic example of a chaotic system in physics.

The core idea is that even a minuscule, imperceptible change in the starting conditions of a double pendulum leads to wildly different, unpredictable long-term behavior. This sensitivity makes it a fascinating source of entropy for generating passwords.

> **Note:** This is an exploratory project demonstrating a concept. It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure random number generator for production use.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Live Physics Simulation:** A visually engaging double pendulum simulation running in real-time.
* **Chaotic Entropy Source:** Uses the pendulum's state at the moment of generation as the seed for the password.
* **Customizable Output:**
    * Adjust password length from 8 to 32 characters.
    * Toggle the inclusion of numbers and symbols.
* **Click-to-Copy:** Easily copy the generated password to your clipboard.
* **Responsive Design:** The simulation and controls adapt to different screen sizes.

## üöÄ The Concept: Chaos as Entropy

How does it work?

1.  **The Simulation:** Two pendulums are started with nearly identical initial conditions (a difference of only `0.00001` radians).
2.  **Chaotic Motion:** Due to the nature of the system, their paths diverge dramatically and unpredictably over time.
3.  **Capture State:** When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the application captures a snapshot of the exact angular position and velocity of one of the pendulums.
4.  **Create Entropy Pool:** These floating-point numbers are concatenated into a long string of digits.
5.  **Build Password:** The entropy string is then used to select characters from a defined character set, building a password that is a direct result of the pendulum's chaotic state at that precise moment.
